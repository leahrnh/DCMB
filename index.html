<h1>What is the DCMB?</h1>

<h2>A Marching Band</h2>
<p class="floatright"><img src="images/homepic.jpg" width="288" height="180"></p>
<p> The Dartmouth College Marching Band is an integral part of many
    Dartmouth sporting events. In the fall, we open every home
    football game with a parade through Hanover, concerts at alumni
    events, a show on the field, the national anthem, and the alma
    mater. During games we keep the crowd
    lively by playing tunes in the stands, and go on the field again
    at halftime. After the game, if Dartmouth wins, we celebrate by
    marching through the library playing our school fight songs. In
    the winter, we continue to play as the <a href="pepBand.html">Pep
    Band!</a>
</p>

<h2>A Scatter Band</h2>
<p> The DCMB has been a scatter band (sometimes called "scramble
    band") since the 1960's. Because we are a small school, we do not
    have the numbers it would take to do formal marching formations,
    like you might have done in high school. Instead, our shows are
    based around a humorous script collectively written each week by
    members of the band. We march out onto the field, but then we run
    into a formation that serves as a compliment or punch line to the
    jokes in the script. As a result we spent very little time on
    marching drill, and have a funny show that generally pokes fun at
    our opponents.
</p>

<h2>A Social Group</h2>
<p>Band members do many things together in addition to playing and
    marching. Our social chairs arrange events including a
    potluck, a scavenger hunt, or anything else that seems
    fun. In the winter the band plays intramural hockey
    together. We're not great, but we have fun! Freshmen often make
    some of their first and closest friends in the band.
